- ðŸ’¡ With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've created a tool that lets you generate secure passwords tailored to your preferences. Here's what it can do:

- âœ… Password Length Slider: Choose a length between 1 and 20 characters with a simple slider.
- âœ… Character Selection: Customize your password by including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- âœ… Generate Password Button: Click to create a new, random password with each click.
- âœ… Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy your generated password with just one click, making it convenient to use across platforms.
- ðŸ’¡Plus, the design is user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless device experience.
